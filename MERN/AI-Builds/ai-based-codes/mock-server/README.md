# Gemini Content Explorer - Mock Server

This server provides all the mock API endpoints required for the Gemini Content Explorer UI.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to this directory**:
    ```bash
    cd mock-server
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The server will start and listen on `http://localhost:3001`. The UI application needs to be running separately and will make requests to this server.
